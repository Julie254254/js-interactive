# JavaScript Assignment

## Overview

This is my assignment for practicing JavaScript interactivity. The page has a basic structure with HTML and CSS, and JavaScript is used to make the page more interactive.

## Files

* **index.html** – main webpage with a form and different sections
* **script.js** – JavaScript file that handles events, adds interactivity, and does custom form validation
* **style.css** – optional file I added to style the page

## Features

* A form with custom validation (not only HTML5 validation)
* Buttons and inputs that respond to user actions
* At least two interactive features
